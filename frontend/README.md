# IT Useful frontend

React and TypeScript with Vite and Tailwind CSS. Run commands inside WSL
using the Node.js 24 version selected by the root `.nvmrc`.

```bash
cd ~/workspace/icebreaker/it-useful
source "$HOME/.nvm/nvm.sh"
nvm use
cd frontend
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173. Stop the server with Ctrl+C.
The server binds to loopback only and fails clearly if its port is occupied.

- `npm run build`: TypeScript check and production output in `dist/`.
- `npm run lint`: starter lint check.
- `npm run preview`: serve the production build at http://localhost:4173.

The current page is a foundation preview, not connected to the backend.
React Router, TanStack Query, React Hook Form, Zod, the Hook Form resolver,
and React Markdown are installed for subsequent implementation groups.
Routing, API access, forms, and testing infrastructure are not implemented yet.

Tailwind uses its Vite plugin and CSS-first theme in `src/index.css`.
The theme provides neutral surfaces, high-contrast text, blue accents,
system fonts (including Cyrillic fallback), and visible keyboard focus.
No external font or image requests are required.
